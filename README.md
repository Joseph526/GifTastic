## About this Project
This is an app to display gifs from GIPHY based on a topic selected by the user. The page is pre-populated with a variety of sports buttons. The user can choose one of those to display the gifs. The user can also choose to add a new button for any topic, then display the corresponding gifs by clicking the new button.

This app is fully mobile responsive because it is made with Bootstrap.
